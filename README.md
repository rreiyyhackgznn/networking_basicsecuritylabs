# Network Security Practice Projects

This repository contains my hands-on network configuration and lab files, developed using Packet Tracer during my network studies.

These files include exercises and simulations covering key network concepts such as VLAN, routing protocols, access control lists, and more.

Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (network simulation environment)

Topics Covered
Each Packet Tracer file focuses on a specific networking topic:

VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing
- Basic VLAN setup
- Inter-VLAN routing configuration

Routing Protocols
- OSPF sample configuration

 Network Services
- DHCP configuration practice

Spanning Tree
- STP concept and switch redundancy

Wireless & Security
- Wireless network setup
- ACL and port security basics

📁 Repository Structure
Each `.pkt` file corresponds to a lab exercise file.  
Additional `.txt` files contain command reference examples used in the labs.

 How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Observe device topologies and configurations.   
3. Run simulations to verify connectivity and behavior.

 Next Steps
- Add Wireshark packet captures for selected labs
- Include Python/Scapy analyzers for network output
- Expand with basic firewall or monitoring examples
